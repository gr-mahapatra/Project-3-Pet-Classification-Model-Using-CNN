# 🐶🐱 Pet Classification Using CNN

## 📌 Problem
Classify images of pets into two categories: cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## 🔧 Tools Used
- TensorFlow, Keras
- ImageDataGenerator (data augmentation)
- CNN (Sequential API)

## 🚀 Highlights
- Built a CNN with 2 Conv layers, pooling, dense and dropout layers
- Achieved 100% training accuracy, 70% validation accuracy
- Addressed overfitting using dropout and augmentation
- Visualized accuracy and loss over epochs
